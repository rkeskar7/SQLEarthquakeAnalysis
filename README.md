# SQLEarthquakeAnalysis

SQL Database â€“ SQLite

The original SQL Database was obtained from: http://2016.padjo.org/tutorials/sqlite-data-starterpacks/#toc-m3-0-earthquakes-in-the-contiguous-u-s-1995-through-2015
and was modified by Reesa Keskar, using SQL commands.
 
The earthquakes were classified as Minor, Light, Moderate, Strong, or Major based on their magnitude, as shown at: http://www.geo.mtu.edu/UPSeis/magnitude.html.
